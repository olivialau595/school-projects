# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This project, created in data structures (CSCI132 - Spring 2014), used stacks and queues to build a 
reverse polish notation calculator. The arithmetic operations included addition, subtraction, 
multiplication. The stack stored polynomial objects and the queue stored the coefficiensts and 
exponenents of each polynomial.
