# War Card Game

This project was created to practice using stacks. (CSCI132 - Spring 2014) Each item in the stack 
held a card. In each round, the user and computer each draw a card from their draw stack, and the 
player with the bigger card adds both to his/her win stack. If there is a tie, both cards go into 
the tie pile. Once a player runs out of cards in his/her draw stack, the cards in the win stack 
are moved to the draw stack. The player with the most cards wins at the end of the game.
